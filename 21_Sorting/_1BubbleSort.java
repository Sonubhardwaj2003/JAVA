// Bubble Sort : Also called the exchanging sorting algo , inplace sorting algo.
//  What Is Bubble Sort?
// Bubble Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.
// Think of it like bubbling up the largest values to the top (end of the list), just like bubbles rising in water.

// üîÅ How It Works ‚Äì Step-by-Step
// - Start at the beginning of the list
// - Compare the first two elements
// - Swap them if the first is greater than the second
// - Move to the next pair and repeat
// - After one full pass, the largest element will be at the end
// - Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted portion
// - Stop when no swaps are needed in a pass

//space-complexcity : O(1) ,, time-Complexcity : best-case = O(N) and Wrost-Case = O(N**2);
// stable : yes
